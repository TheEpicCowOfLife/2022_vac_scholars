Some sets have been deleted due to large file sizes, but i guess I won't need to test on them.

Set 0 is trivial, requires very basic deduction (naked single, etc)
Set 1 is apparently easy, (to investigate)
Set 2 is also quite easy, but requires more patterns.
Sets 3-6 are really hard, requires a lot of brute force deduction. The sets are supposedly ordered in difficulty (not the sudokus inside the grid)
Set 7 have multiple solutions
Set 8 have none

pathological is a test case adversarially generated against the DR algorithm. Has low success rate.
